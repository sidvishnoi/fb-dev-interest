# Configure

### App Token (required)

Get your app token from [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/accesstoken/](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/accesstoken/). You might need to create a Facebook Developer Account and/or a app. Create an app if not exists and get the App Token (not User Token) and paste in App Token field in extension's options page.

The App Token is needed to authenticate Facebook's Graph API requests.

### My Interests

Add the keywords that interest you in this field to filter posts. Type a keyword and press Enter to add it. Click a keyword to remove it. We've added some keywords as suggestions. You can contribute by adding more keywords :)

### Highlight Keyword Matches

Enable to highlight matched keywords in posts, otherwise disable.

### Blacklist Groups

Add a group's name (and make use to autocomplete) to blacklist it (avoid showing posts from that group in your feed). You might want to blacklist a group as you might not be interested in their posts or not able to understand their language.
